# WTCVolumeProfile - Forex Market Analysis Tool

This code is a Forex market analysis tool called WTCVolumeProfile, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to analyze volume data and generate volume profiles for different currency pairs in real-time. The tool provides valuable information on volume distribution, support and resistance levels, and can be used to enhance trading strategies.

## How It Works

The code performs the following steps:

1. Includes necessary libraries:
   - `Trade.mqh` for trading operations
   - `ChartObjects.mqh` for chart object manipulation

2. Defines constants:
   - `SYMBOL` as the currency pair (e.g. EURUSD)
   - `TIMEFRAME` as the time period (e.g. H1)

3. Defines global variables:
   - `trade` as a `CTrade` object for trading operations
   - `label` as a `CChartObject` object for displaying volume distribution information

4. Initializes the trading robot in the `OnInit()` function:
   - Sets up the trade object with a magic number and expert comment
   - Creates a label for displaying volume distribution information on the chart
   - Subscribes to the necessary symbol and timeframe
   - Applies a template for volume profile visualization

5. Analyzes volume data and generates volume profiles in the `AnalyzeVolumeProfiles()` function:
   - Retrieves volume data from the Forex market for the specified symbol and timeframe
   - Generates volume profiles based on the retrieved volume data
   - Calculates volume distribution information such as maximum, minimum, and average volume
   - Displays the volume distribution information on the chart using the label object
   - Allows customization of volume profile settings based on user preferences
   - Provides real-time updates of volume profiles as market conditions change
   - Overlays volume profiles on price charts for better analysis
   - Identifies key support and resistance levels based on volume data
   - Performs trading strategies to enhance the effectiveness of the tool
   - Sleeps for a specified time before updating again

6. Cleans up resources and exits the trading robot in the `OnDeinit()` function:
   - Removes the label from the chart
   - Closes any open positions
   - Unsubscribes from the symbol and timeframe

7. Sets the entry point of the trading robot in the `OnTick()` function:
   - Calls the `AnalyzeVolumeProfiles()` function to start analyzing volume profiles
